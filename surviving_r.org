* Clarifications

*** R, RStudio, and the tidyverse

- R vs RStudio

- Base R vs tidyverse (we will see the difference between tibbles vs data frames in a concrete example).

- Core tidyverse vs other tidyverse packages

#+BEGIN_red
R, RStudio, and the tidyverse all 3 very different things!

Because many RStudio users never open R directly, they do not realize that R is doing the work. R needs to be updated regularly and you certainly cannot uninstall it.

- R is a software and computer language. Without it, nothing works
- RStudio is an IDE (integrated development environment) allowing a nicer experience while working in R
- the tidyverse is a set of R packages

So... you can use the tidyverse without using RStudio, you can use RStudio without using any of the tidyverse packages, but you cannot use RStudio without using R. As soon as you use RStudio, you *are* using R.
#+END_red

**** Updating

Since all 3 are totally distinct, they need to be updated independently:

#+BEGIN_red
- updating RStudio will in no way bring you to an up to date version of R
- updating R will not update the tidyverse
- etc.
#+END_red

#+BEGIN_vertbar
Your task: update R, RStudio (if you use it), and all your packages
#+END_vertbar

#+BEGIN_quote
*Warning:* there is always a risk to break something with updates. Do them when you have time, *don't do them* just before an important event during which you will need R.
#+END_quote

If you don't want to take this risk now, then don't! but do your updates when you get home.

Some packages will not install or update unless you have administrative privilege:

Run src_R[:eval no]{install.packages()} directly in R (not RStudio), in a session with administrative privilege.

*** Working directory, working environment, history

**** What are all these weird dot files?

src_R[:eval no]{.RData}/src_R[:eval no]{.Rda}
src_R[:eval no]{.Rds}
src_R[:eval no]{.Rhistory}
src_R[:eval no]{.Rproj}

**** What should I save?

#+BEGIN_vertbar
Change your RStudio default options now
#+END_vertbar

*** What is what in R?

- Data types

- Data class

- Functions

#+BEGIN_red
Learn the vocabulary!

You really need it:

1. to google the right terms and find answers to your problems
2. to understand the help files
#+END_red

* Common sources of problems

- Working environment and file locations

  Where is R running? You might not be where you think you are...

- File extensions not visible in finder or windows explorer

#+BEGIN_vertbar
Go to Finder or Windows explorer now and make your file extensions visible
#+END_vertbar

- Transformation not saved in an object

- Unexpected coercion

  src_R[:eval no]{str()} is your friend.

- NA

  Think about what they mean:
   - your missing data might not be true NA
   - different NA mean different things and need to be handled differently

* Finding information

** In R itself

R, as well as any package you have installed, comes with a lot of documentation. This can be invaluable if you do not have internet access.

*** Manuals

General manuals on R can be found by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
help.start()
#+END_SRC

*** Packages

To get information on a package called <package>, you can run:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
package?<package>
#+END_SRC

For instance src_R[:eval no]{package?data.table}.

And to get a list of the functions in a package, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
help(package = <package>)
#+END_SRC

For instance src_R[:eval no]{help(package = data.table)}.

Note that, for this to work, the package doesn't need to be loaded. But of course, it does need to be installed on your machine.

In the case of packages hosted on CRAN, a pdf containing the information for all the package functions can also be download from the web. Such package manuals are easy to find by googling "CRAN <package>".

*** Functions

Any serious package contains the documentation of every function in help files.

You can get a detailed description of a function called <function> by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
?<function>
#+END_SRC

For instance src_R[:eval no]{?map}.

For this to work, the package containing this function needs to be loaded. So the above line will only work if you have previously loaded the package src_R[:eval no]{purrr}. Alternatively, you can run src_R[:eval no]{?purrr::map}.

**** How to make sense of the function help files?

Let's walk through some help files together.

*** Vignettes

Packages also sometime contain additional information in "vignettes": tutorials on how to use the package.

**** List vignettes

To list all the vignettes for a package called <package>, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vignette(package = "<package>")
#+END_SRC

For instance src_R[:eval no]{vignette(package = "dplyr")}.

Note that, for this to work, the package doesn't need to be loaded. But of course, it does need to be installed on your machine.

To list all the vignettes from the *loaded* packages:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vignette(all = F)
#+END_SRC
     
To list all the vignettes from all *installed* packages:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vignette()
#+END_SRC

**** Open a vignette

Once you have found the name of a vignette pertaining to the topic you are interested in, you can open it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vignette("<vignette>")
#+END_SRC

For instance src_R[:eval no]{vignette("two-table")}.

*** Versions information

R and all loaded packages:

#+BEGIN_src R
sessionInfo()
#+END_src

One package only

#+BEGIN_src R
packageVersion("<package>")
#+END_src

** Online

*** Online books

Several excellent books on R are-on top of their paper version-available as [[https://bookdown.org/][bookdowns]]. There are also great manuals and tutorials.

**** Getting started with R and the tidyverse

The book [[http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html][R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham]] is a must read for all beginner/intermediate R users, as well as advanced users not familiar with the tidyverse. This book will get you started with good habits and is an excellent introduction to R.

Go to this book right now (you can find it by googling "r for data science") and bookmark the following chapters:

#+BEGIN_box
- 3 Data visualisation
- 5 Data transformation
- 10 Tibbles
- 11.3.4 Dates, date-times, and times
- 12.3.1 Gathering
- 18 Pipes
- 20 Vectors
#+END_box

**** Writing readable and well-formatted code

While syntax matters greatly in code execution (e.g. missing quotes, commas, or parenthesis will affect the meaning of your code), R will equally run formatted and non-formatted code.

Code, however, should not simply be written for the machine and should be made as human readable as possible. This is key, for instance, for code sharing and code review. While there are no official R formatting guidelines, [[http://style.tidyverse.org/][Hadley Wickham wrote a short book on R formatting]]. [[https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml][Google's R Style Guide]] offers another popular (and quite similar) set of recommendations. Whichever formatting rules you choose, it is important that you commit to them for the sake of *formatting consistency*.

Of note, when you work on someone else's code, you should adopt their style, again, for the sake of consistency.

**** Understanding R as a programming language

The book [[https://adv-r.hadley.nz/][Advanced R by Hadley Wickham]] will give you a better understanding of R as a programming language and help you get to the next level of R writing.

[[http://adv-r.had.co.nz/][The first edition]] of that book, which focuses on base R rather than on the tidyverse, is also well worth a read.

**** Writing your own packages

The book [[http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/][R packages by Hadley Wickham]] will get you started if you want to write your own packages.

The on-line manual [[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html][Writing R Extensions by the R Core Team]] gives a more dense and exhaustive documentation if you need something that is not in Hadley's book.

**** GIS in R

The tutorials [[https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/tutorial/an-introduction-to-spatial-data-analysis-and-visualisation-in-r][An Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis and Visualisation in R by Guy Lansley and James Cheshire]] as well as the book [[https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/][Geocomputation with R by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow]] will teach you how to map data and conduct spacial data analysis in R or how to bridge R and [[https://www.qgis.org/en/site/][QGIS]].

*** Cheatsheets

Who doesn't love cheatsheets? Good news: RStudio and others created [[https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/][great cheatsheets]] on the tidyverse and a few other packages. If you use the tidyverse, those are absolute must have.

Go to that page right now (you can find it by googling "rstudio cheatsheet") and download:

#+BEGIN_box
- Work with Strings Cheat Sheet
- Data Import Cheat Sheet
- Data Transformation Cheat Sheet
- RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet
- Data Visualization Cheat Sheet
#+END_box

/Note: some of these cheatsheet are accessible from within RStudio, under the help menu./

** At SFU

*** The Research Commons

The SFU Research Commons offers [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc/services/consultations#r-help-and-consultations][consultations]], [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc/services/workshops#r-software][workshops]], and online resources for R.

The Research Commons is also a partner of [[https://software-carpentry.org/][Software Carpentry]] and [[http://www.datacarpentry.org/][Data Carpentry]], now merged under [[http://carpentries.org/][the Carpentries]]. The Carpentries organize workshops-including workshops on R-regularly. You can find their upcoming workshops on their [[https://carpentries.org/][website]].

*** Library

The SFU library owns several classic books on R. Don't hesitate to talk to a librarian if you need help finding them. And remember that you can also suggest new book acquisitions if important books are missing from the collection.

*** The Scientific Programming Study Group

[[http://sciprog.ca/][SciProg]], short for Scientific Programming Study Group, is an SFU student lead group open to anyone interested in learning or sharing programming resources through workshops, hackathons, and other events. R workshops are regularly offered. If you are interested in learning about a particular topic (or if you are interested in giving workshops), get in touch!

* Trouble-shooting

Make a list

#+BEGIN_red
1. *Read the error message*
2. Look for typos (R is case sensitive)
3. Re-start your R process
4. Make sure your working directory is where you think it is and your files are where you think they are
5. Update R, RStudio if you use it, and your packages
6. Look at the help files of the functions involved
7. Google using judicious keywords
8. If relevant, look for explanations and examples in Hadley's books and/or RStudio cheatsheets
9. Simplify your non running code until it starts running or alternatively start very simple and add elements until the code breaks
#+END_red

If, after doing all of these, you are stick stuck, then ask for help. Here are a number of options:

#+BEGIN_red
- ask your supervisor
- ask your peers
- book a consultation with an R peer at the Research Commons
- post a question in Stack Overflow or the RStudio Community website
#+END_red

If you decide to go for the last option, *make a reproducible example first* or you will get your head chopped off.

* Getting help

*** Where to ask for help

**** At SFU

The SFU Research Commons offers one-on-one [[https://www.lib.sfu.ca/about/branches-depts/rc/services/consultations#r-help-and-consultations][consultations]] to help you with your R code.

**** Online

R has a wonderful community. But different sites have different cultures and you should familiarise yourself with a forum before posting to it.

# - so
# - rsc
# - twitter
# - slack r4ds
# - mailing lists

*** How to ask for help

**** The golden rules

The R community is full of people keen to help you: you will be amazed. But if you want to receive good help, you need to do your part. In order for others to understand your issue and be able to help you, the code that you post online needs to follow 4 (even better 5) rules, which are that it:

#+BEGIN_red
1. makes sense without being run,
2. can be run,
3. does not contain sensitive or personal data,
4. does not use data which needs to be downloaded,
5. (optionally) does not contain more than is necessary to reproduce the problem.
#+END_red

Let's go over each point. The posted code:

***** 1. makes sense without being run

This means that it includes the code and its output: not everybody wants to run your code and they may be able to see what is going on just by looking at this.

***** 2. can be run

Anyone copying your code and running it on their machine should get output you got. This is necessary for others to test potential solutions without having to do the work of first making up data that looks like yours.

***** 3. does not contain sensitive or personal data

If your data is sensitive, it needs to be [[id:h:5fa991db-3c7d-4e83-a5bc-de6ac1000ee7][anonymised]] or you need to make up fake data of a similar structure.

***** 4. does not use data which needs to be downloaded

If your code uses, for instance, data from a .csv file, the code alone will not run. Uploading your .csv file for others to download is tedious and many people will not be keen to download it. The [[id:h:b409126d-9278-4647-aff2-1f18fe600857][data should be recreated from the code you post]].

***** 5. (optionally) does not contain more than is necessary to reproduce the problem

While not absolutely necessary, reducing your code to the simplest and smallest sample necessary to reproduce your problem will make it easier for others to pinpoint what is going on. Additionally, it is likely that you will find the problem yourself in the process of producing this "minimal reproducible example".

**** How do I follow the golden rules?
