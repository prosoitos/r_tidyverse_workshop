* Surviving R

** Avoiding common traps, Finding information, Trouble-shooting, Getting help

*** Description

Once a few basic concepts are clear and you know where to find information or how to ask for it, you can navigate R effectively. This workshop will bring you to this happy place.

Subjects covered include:
- Clarification of common misconceptions
- Common traps
- Where to find excellent and free resources to learn R
- How to read R help files
- How to troubleshoot your code
- Where to go for help
- How to properly ask for help: reprex, anonymization, and the culture of various forums

*** Target audience

This workshop is open to current SFU students, staff, and faculty of all levels and will benefit anyone feeling a little confused in the R world or unsure where to find good R resources, how to ask for help with a reproducible example, and what to do when stuck.

*** Requirements

Participants need to bring a laptop with: the latest R release[fn:1] and the latest CRAN version of the package "tidyverse"[fn:2].
